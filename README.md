# Product Recommendation Platform

This project is a product display and recommendation platform developed using **Django**, **Angular**, and **MongoDB**. 
It is not a real shopping website — there is no actual payment or checkout system. This project was created as part of my graduation thesis.

##  Features

- **Web scraping for product data**: Products are collected from various websites using web scraping and stored in a MongoDB database.
- **User management**: Includes features such as registration, login, and adding products to favorites.
- **Recommendation system**: Dynamically recommends products based on users’ browsing and favorite history.
- **Technologies**:
  - Backend: Django 
  - Frontend: Angular
  - Database: MongoDB (connected via MongoEngine)

##  Notes

- This is not a real e-commerce platform and does not include any purchasing or payment system.
- MongoDB connection credentials have been removed for security reasons.
- If you want to run it with your own database, you will need to create a `.env` file and add your credentials manually.
